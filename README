Komfortkasse PHP Example for "Generic" (API) Access

You need:
- a webserver with PHP
- a valid Komfortkasse login
- the API Key and Accesscode of your Komfortkasse dealer account

You don't need:
- mysql (or any other database)


Instructions:
=============

1.
Copy these files to a folder of your webserver. The webserver must be reachable
from the internet if you want to test full functionality.

2.
Enter your API Key and Accesscode in the file komfortkasse_settings.php

3.
Open komfortkasse_send.php in a browser: this will send an example order to 
your Komfortkasse account. (Every newly generated order number will be stored 
in the file order_numbers.txt.)
Warning! this will be a "real" order, but you can mark this order as cancelled 
later on. Please contact support if you want to permanently delete those 
example orders.

4.
Open your Komfortkasse Dealer Area and set the URL of your server and the 
path of the file komfortkasse_receive.php in the API settings.
Example: /your/path/komfortkasse_receive.php

5.
Click "Read orders" in the Komfortkasse Dealer Area. You should get a message 
saying "No new orders read".

6.
Now add a order number of your choice to the file order_numbers.txt. This 
simulates a order that has been added, but not transferred via API (e.g.
because there was a network problem). Open your Komfortkasse Dealer Area and
select "Read orders" again. You should now see a message saying "1 new orders 
read." 

7.
Mark one of the orders as paid in your Komfortkasse Dealer Area (select 
"orders" in the main menu, select an order, then click "Mark as paid"). Then 
click "Perform update". You should see a message "1 orders updated".
Plus, the order number and payment status was written to the file 
received_updates.txt. You can repeat this step with cancelling an order.

If all the above steps are working, the PHP test environment for Komfortkasse
works. You can now start to integrate your real system into those php files.
